# Three.js Realistic Render

1. We are going to use an environment map to illuminate the model but we will need DirectionalLight to have more control and create shadows.

2. Using environment map the color of the environment is applied to the model.
   The lighting will be taken care by the environment map.
   An environment map is like a photo of surrounding and it can be a 360 photo or 6 photos that compose a cube.
   We will use environment map both for the background and to illuminate our model.
